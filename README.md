### Project 1: Analysis of the Electric Vehicle Market in Korea

- **Description**: This award-winning project provides an in-depth analysis of the electric vehicle (EV) market in Korea. By employing advanced data visualization techniques, the project examines current market trends, consumer adoption rates, and regional distribution of EVs.
- **Key Findings/Results**: he analysis revealed significant growth in EV adoption in urban areas, influenced by government incentives and expanding charging infrastructure. These insights are instrumental for stakeholders in strategic planning and policy formulation.
### Project 2: Blood Pressure and Glucose Level Prediction

- **Description**: This project focuses on developing predictive models for blood pressure and glucose levels using machine and deep learning techniques. By analyzing patient data, the models aim to predict health metrics, facilitating early intervention and personalized healthcare.
- **Tools & Technologies**: Python, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn
- **Key Findings/Results**: The models achieved high accuracy in predictions, demonstrating the potential of AI in preemptive healthcare measures. This work contributes to the development of tools that can assist healthcare providers in monitoring and managing patient health effectively.
 
### Project 3: Cryptocurrency Market Prediction using Dual Method: Sentiment Analysis AI and Statistical Analysis

- **Description**: This project aims to predict cryptocurrency market movements by employing a dual-method approach that combines a sentiment analysis AI model with traditional statistical analysis. The sentiment analysis AI, named '갈대' (Reed), was developed using deep learning techniques to interpret and quantify the sentiment expressed in social media data. Real-time data is directly fetched and processed by '갈대' to gauge the current market sentiment. Subsequently, this sentiment data, along with historical market data from platforms like Reddit and Twitter, is analyzed using statistical models to predict future market trends.

- **Tools & Technologies**: Python, TensorFlow for deep learning model development; APIs for real-time data fetching from social media; statistical analysis tools in Python; web development technologies for creating a user-facing website.

- **Key Findings/Results**: The integration of sentiment analysis with statistical methods provided a more nuanced understanding of market dynamics, enabling more accurate predictions of future movements. The sentiment analysis AI, '갈대', effectively captured the prevailing sentiment from social media platforms, which, when combined with statistical analysis of historical data, resulted in predictions with improved accuracy.

- **Project Deliverables**:
    - Sentiment analysis AI model '갈대' trained on vast datasets from social media.
    - A real-time data processing system that fetches, stores, and analyzes data from social media and cryptocurrency markets.
    - Statistical analysis of sentiment and market data to predict cryptocurrency market trends.
    - A prototype website that disseminates the analyzed data and predictions to users.

This project exemplifies the power of combining AI and machine learning with traditional statistical methods to interpret complex data and predict market trends in the highly volatile cryptocurrency market.
